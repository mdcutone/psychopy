class AudioFileWriter:
    """Asyncronous audio file writer.

    This class is used to write audio samples to a file in a separate thread.
    This is useful for recording audio in real-time and writing to disk without
    blocking the main thread.

    A single audio writer can only be associated with a single file. If you need
    to write to multiple files, create a new writer for each file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        File name for the output. This can be a relative or absolute path.
    sampleRate : int
        Samples rate of the audio for playback in Hertz (Hz). Adjust to match
        the sample rate of the audio data being written. Default is `48000`.
    channels : int
        Number of audio channels in the file. Either `1` (mono) or `2` (stereo).
        Default is `1`.
    codec : str
        Codec used to encode the audio file. Default is `'wav'`.
    encoderLib : str
        Library used to encode the audio file. Default is `'soundfile'`.
    encoderOpts : dict
        Options used to encode the audio file. These are settings that are 
        passed to the encoder when opening the file for writing. Use this to 
        specify additional options that are specific to the encoder. Default is 
        `None`.
    keepTempFile : bool
        Keep any temporary files created during encoding. This is usually not 
        needed, however it can be useful for debugging or to retain the original
        audio data that can be recovered in the event of a crash. Temporary
        files usually have the same name as the final file with an additional
        extension (e.g., `.raw`). Default is `False`.
    fileExistsPolicy : str
        Policy to use when the output file already exists. Options are 
        `'overwrite'` (default), `'append'`, `'raise'`, `'rename'`, and
        `'increment'`. If `'overwrite'`, the file will be overwritten. If
        `'append'`, the file will be opened for appending. If `'raise'`, an
        exception will be raised. If `'rename'`, the file will be renamed. If
        `'increment'`, the file will be incremented. Default is `'overwrite'`.

    Examples
    --------
    Open a writer and write some samples to a file::

        # create a writer object and open the file
        writer = AudioFileWriter('test.wav', SAMPLE_RATE_48kHz)
        writer.open()

        # generate and add audio samples to the file
        writer.addSamples(
            sinetone(0.5, 440.0, gain=0.8, sampleRateHz=SAMPLE_RATE_48kHz))
        writer.addSamples(
            squaretone(0.5, 440.0, gain=0.8, sampleRateHz=SAMPLE_RATE_48kHz))
        writer.addSamples(
            sawtone(0.5, 440.0, gain=0.8, sampleRateHz=SAMPLE_RATE_48kHz))

        # close the file
        writer.close()

    Notes
    -----
    * Some encoders require a temporary file to be created since they cannot
      write directly to the final file. The audio data is converted to the
      requested format upon closing the file.
