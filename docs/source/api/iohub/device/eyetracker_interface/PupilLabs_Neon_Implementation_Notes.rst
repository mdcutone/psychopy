High Level Neon Introduction
**********************************

`Neon <https://pupil-labs.com/products/neon/>`__ is a calibration-free, wearable eye tracker.
The system consists of two inward-facing eye cameras and one forward-facing world camera
mounted on a wearable eyeglasses-like frame.

Neon provides gaze data in its world camera's field of view, regardless of the wearer's
head position. As such, gaze can be analysed with the wearer looking and moving freely
in their environment.

Neon is unlike remote eye trackers which employ cameras mounted on or near a computer monitor.
They provide gaze in screen-based coordinates, and this facilitates closed-loop analyses of
gaze based on the known position of stimuli on-screen and eye gaze direction.

To use Neon for screen-based work in |PsychoPy|, the screen needs to be robustly located within
the world camera's field of view, and Neon's gaze data subsequently transformed from world
camera-based coordinates to screen-based coordinates. This is achieved with the use of
`AprilTag Markers <https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/software/pupil-capture/#markers>`__.

Device, Software, and Connection Setup
**************************************

Setting Up the Eye Tracker
==========================

1. Follow `Neon's Getting Started
   guide <https://docs.pupil-labs.com/neon/#getting-started>`_ to setup
   the headset and companion device.

Setting Up |PsychoPy|
=====================

1. Install the ``Pupil Labs`` plugin using the Plugin Manager and restart Builder.
2. Open ``experiment settings`` in the Builder Window (cog icon in top panel)
3. Open the ``Eyetracking`` tab
4. Modify the properties as follows:

   -  Select ``Pupil Labs (Neon)`` from the ``Eyetracker Device`` drop down menu
   -  ``Companion address`` / ``Companion port`` - Defines how to connect to
      the Companion Device. These values can be found in the Neon Companion app by clicking the
      ``Stream`` button in the top-left corner of the app.

5. Add AprilTag components to the routines that require eyetracking.
   -  The ``April Tag Frame`` component provides an easy way to add an array of AprilTag markers around the edges of the display.
   -  If the ``April Tag Frame`` is not workable (for example, you need to render a stimulus in the corner of the display), advanced marker placement is possible using individual ``April Tag`` components.
      -  Three markers is generally considered a bare minimum, but more markers will yield more robust detection and more accurate mapping.
      -  All markers which are displayed simultaneously must each use a unique marker ID.
      -  Markers can be placed anywhere on the screen as long as they are fully visible and do not overlap.

A `sample experiment <https://github.com/pupil-labs/psychopy-gaze-contingent-demo>`_ is available for reference.

Supported Event Types
=====================

The Neonâ€“|PsychoPy| integration provides real-time access to
:py:class:`BinocularEyeSampleEvents <psychopy.iohub.devices.eyetracker.BinocularEyeSampleEvent>`
events. The supported fields are described below.

.. autoclass:: psychopy.iohub.devices.eyetracker.BinocularEyeSampleEvent

    .. attribute:: device_time
        :type: float

        time of gaze measurement, in sec.msec format, using Pupil Capture clock

    .. attribute:: logged_time
        :type: float

        time at which the sample was received in PsychoPy, in sec.msec format, using
        PsychoPy clock

    .. attribute:: time
        :type: float

        time of gaze measurement, in sec.msec format, using PsychoPy clock

    .. attribute:: delay
        :type: float

        The difference between ``logged_time`` and ``time``, in sec.msec format

    .. attribute:: gaze_x
        :type: float

        x component of gaze location in display coordinates. Set to ``float("nan")`` in
        pupillometry-only mode.

    .. attribute:: gaze_y
        :type: float

        y component of gaze location in display coordinates. Set to ``float("nan")`` in
        pupillometry-only mode.
